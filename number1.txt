You are tasked with designing a Jetpack Compose @Composable function named
LabEq to manage lab resources. The function should satisfy the following requirements:
Input Fields:
• Include two OutlinedTextField composables to input the number of computers and students, respectively.
• The first OutlinedTextField should prompt for the number of computers
available in the lab.
• The second OutlinedTextField should prompt for the number of students
intending to use the lab.
Button Functionality:
• Implement a Button composable labeled ”Check Student Numbers” to
validate the availability of resources.
• Upon clicking the button, calculate the availability of computers compared to the number of students.
• If the number of computers exceeds the number of students, display a
message indicating that the lab can be used for the test.
• If the number of students exceeds the number of computers, compute
the additional computers required and display a message accordingly.
Message Display:
• Utilize a Text composable to dynamically display the message based on
the comparison results.
• Ensure the message is styled using the bodyMedium typography defined
in the MaterialTheme.
Modifiers and Layout:


• Apply appropriate modifiers to achieve padding and spacing within the
column layout.
• Arrange the composables vertically with a specified spacing between
them.
Input Validation:
• Validate user input to ensure that only numeric values are accepted for
both the number of computers and students.
• Handle cases where invalid or empty input is provided by defaulting to
a value of 0.
Lab Name Argument:
• Accept the name of the lab as a parameter (labName) in the LabEq function.
Submission Guidelines:
• Submit only the code for yourLabEq composable function under Question
6
